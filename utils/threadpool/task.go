// Task is the interface for the task to be executed by the thread pool.
//
// The return value of the methods is time.Time, which means the next disired execution time. It can be smaller than the current time.
//   - If a task is not going to be executed again, the return value of Task.Execute should be time.Time{}.
//   - If a task wants to be executed as soon as possible, the return value of Task.Execute should be time.Now().
//
// Note that:
//   - It is not guaranteed that a task will be executed at the exact disired time. The task scheduler will try to execute the task as soon as possible.
//   - It is not guaranteed that a task will be executed by the same goroutine.
//   - It is guaranteed that a task can only be executed by one goroutine at a time. I.e. a task will not be executed concurrently.
//   - The thread pool guarantees the call of Task.Execute is thread-safe. I.e. you don't need to add any locks in the Execute method to guarantee the thread safety,
//     including the visibility of the fields in the Task or any other memory. But you still need to guarantee the thread safety between
//     the Task.Execute and other methods of the Task.
//
// If you want to remove a task from the task scheduler, use one of the approaches below(using both is also fine):
//   - The future call of Task.Execute method returns Done and time.Time{}
//   - Call the TaskHandle.Cancel method. Note that the task will not be removed immediately, but will be removed before the next execution.
//     If the task is already running, the execution will not be stopped immediately.
//
// Refer to task_example.go for a typical implementation of the Task interface.
