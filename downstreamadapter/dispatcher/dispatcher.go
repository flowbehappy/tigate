/*
Dispatcher is responsible for getting events from LogService and sending them to Sink in appropriate order.
Each dispatcher only deal with the events of one tableSpan in one changefeed.
Each dispatcher corresponds to an event dispatcher task, working for the core work of the dispatcher.
All dispatchers in the changefeed of the same node will share the same Sink.
All dispatchers will communicate with the Maintainer about self progress and whether can push down the blocked event.

Because Sink does not flush events to the downstream in strict order.
the dispatcher can't send event to Sink continuously all the time,
1. The ddl event/sync point event can be send to Sink only when the previous event has beed flushed to downstream successfully.
2. Only when the ddl event/sync point event is flushed to downstream successfully, the dispatcher can send the following event to Sink.
3. For the cross table ddl event/sync point event, dispatcher needs to negotiate with the maintainer to decide whether and when send it to Sink.

The workflow related to the dispatcher is as follows:

		+------------+       +----------------+       +------------+       +--------+       +--------+       +------------+
		| LogService |  -->  | EventCollector |  -->  | Dispatcher |  -->  |  Sink  |  -->  | Worker |  -->  | Downstream |
		+------------+       +----------------+       +------------+       +--------+       +--------+       +------------+
	                                                        |
