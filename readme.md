TiCDC
====
TiCDC pulls change logs from TiDB clusters and pushes them to downstream systems, such as MySQL, TiDB, Kafka, Pulsar, and Object Storages (e.g., S3). Beginning from v8.6, we use this repository to build TiCDC instead of the old repository [tiflow](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow). The new TiCDC in this repository has undergone a complete architectural redesign while retaining the same user interface. The architectural upgrade primarily aims to address certain drawbacks of TiCDC and propel it forward.

* **Better scalability**. E.g. support over 1 million tables.
* **More efficiency**. Use less machine resource to support large volume.
* **Better maintainability**. E.g. simpler and human readable code, clear code module, and open to extensions.
* **Cloud native architecture**. We want to design a new architecture from the ground to support the cloud.
